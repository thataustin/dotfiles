dotfiles
========
`rake` to install dotfile and my modified maximum-awesome install to a new computer (semi-tested)

####Dotfiles include:

* [Z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
* My fork of [maximum-awesome](https://github.com/thataustin/maximum-awesome)

####Other environment notes

* I use [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) for versioning
* I use [codemod](https://github.com/facebook/codemod) for massive search-replace
    * Usually, codemod is behind python in versions, so I use pyenv for switching versions around
